ROS NAVIGATION on hydro
========================

Launching mir_2dnav package
===========================

For simulation:

		roslaunch mir_bringup_sim robot.launch

For real robot:

		roslaunch mir_bringup robot.launch

For omnidirectional navigation:

		roslaunch mir_2dnav 2dnav_omni.launch

For differential navigation:

		roslaunch mir_2dnav 2dnav_diff.launch

Run gazebo and rviz:

		rosrun gazebo_ros gzclient
		rosrun rviz rviz

Configure rviz
==============

Select:

		global options -> set the fixed frame to -> map

Add visualization (expand and select topic):

		LaserScan -> /scan_front
		LaserScan -> /scan_rear
		Map -> /map
		Path -> /move_base/DWAPlannerROS/global_plan
		Path -> /move_base/DWAPPlannerROS/local_plan

Navigate
========

Check for this first:

		make sure you have configured properly rviz, and that the map is loaded and displayed

Estimate 2D nav pose from the simulation environment (gazebo):

		Visualize on gazebo the youbot and see where is it located and in which direction the robot is pointing

Give the 2D nav pose information to rviz:

		On rviz click on "2D Pose Estimate" button and give the estimated pose of the youbot obtained from the previous step

Set the goal pose of the youbot:

		Click on "2D Nav Goal" and give the goal pose

The robot should be navigating now from the current pose to the requested goal pose.

remark: map is being loaded from this location:

		~/ros_ws/at_work/src/mas_common_robotics/mcr_environments/mcr_default_env_config/brsu-c025/map.pgm

make sure map.gpm is there along with map.yaml configuration file


General issues
==============

Map is being loaded from this location:

		~/at_work_catkin_ws/src/mas_common_robotics/mcr_environments/mcr_default_env_config/brsu-c069/

Should be launched from this location:

		~/at_work_catkin_ws/src/mas_common_robotics/mcr_environments/mcr_default_env_config/brsu-c025/

Oscar issues
============

Missing tranformations does not allow me to fully visualize the youbot on rviz


Troubleshooting while compiling
===============================
		
gksudo error:

		export USE_NORMAL_SUDO=1
		sudo ls
